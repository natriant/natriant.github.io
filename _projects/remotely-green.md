Initiated during the Port Hackathon at CERN in 2019, Remotely Green created a virtual collaboration platform designed 
to make online events more sustainable and socially engaging. <!--more--> The tool estimated the environmental impact of meeting activities while enabling 
meaningful networking, spontaneous discussions, and accessible participation. I was part of Team Tech. 


 The project supported the UN Sustainable Development Goals on Decent Work (8), Climate Action (13), and Partnerships for the Goals (17).
