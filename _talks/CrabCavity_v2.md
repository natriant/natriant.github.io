This talk discusses studies of emittance growth driven by noise in the crab cavity RF system, a key aspect of the High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. 

<!--more-->

Results from experimental campaigns in the SPS show the impact of transverse beam coupling impedance and provide new insights into the mechanisms behind emittance growth in the presence of crab cavities
