This talk presents simulations and measurements of betatron and off-momentum cleaning during the LHC energy ramp from 450 GeV to 6.8 TeV. 
<!--more-->
It highlights the comparison between simulated and experimental data, demonstrating the accuracy of newly developed tools and their importance for understanding the collimation performance in this complex phase of the LHC cycle.
