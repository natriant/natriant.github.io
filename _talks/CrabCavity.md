This talk presents the results from the machine development studies with the Crab Cavities that took place in the SPS in 2022. 
<!--more-->
These studies demonstrated experimentally for the first time  the mechanism of the suppression of the emittance growth, induced by noise in the Crab Cavity RF system, from the beam coupling impedance.
