This talk examines the luminosity potential of light-ion operation in the LHC beyond Run 4, as a way to achieve higher nucleon-nucleon luminosity to match the objectives of Run 5. 
A numerical computational program that accounts for realistic limitations in the injectors, is used together with 6D beam-tracking simulations, to assess achievable performance for various species. Results indicate that lighter ions, notably oxygen, could yield up to a fourfold luminosity increase compared to the nominal Pbâ€“Pb scenario.
