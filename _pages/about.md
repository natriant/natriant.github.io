An applied physicist with a PhD and experience in data analysis, modeling, and system monitoring.


I work with complex datasets and computational tools to extract insights, validate models, and support data-driven decisions.


I enjoy applying analytical thinking and physics-based methods to solve real-world problems and contribute to meaningful, data-informed projects.


Welcome to my personal space — a collection of my work, projects, and ideas, both professional and beyond.
